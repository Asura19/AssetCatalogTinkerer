An app that lets you open `.car` files and browse/extract their images.

How to use
==========

The app can open any `.car` file, usually located within an app's `Resources` directory.

Once you have an asset catalog opened, you can drag individual assets out or export the entire catalog / selected images to a directory.

## Supported file types

Since version 2.2, Asset Catalog Tinkerer can now read "theme store" files, not only catalog files. "Theme store" files contain assets for UI components, you can find examples of them in `/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemAppearance.bundle`.
